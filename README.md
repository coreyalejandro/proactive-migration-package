## Overview

The PROACTIVE AI Constitution is a systematic framework for AI safety research that operationalizes a core thesis:

> **Reliability failures are safety failures.** When an AI system makes confident claims about reality that are false, and users must rely on those claims to act, the resulting harm is operationally indistinguishable from malice—regardless of intent.

This toolkit provides everything needed to go from research idea to arXiv-ready publication, aligned with Anthropic's Responsible Scaling Policy and contemporary AI safety research standards.

---

## Core Thesis

```
"Epistemic reliability is a safety requirement, not a quality feature."
```

The framework addresses this through three integrated mechanisms:

1. **Cognitive Operating Layer (COL)**: A boundary layer that compiles user intent, constraints, and risk posture into a traceable representation before any action is taken

2. **PROACTIVE Constitution**: Nine enforceable behavioral constraints implemented as gates that cannot be bypassed

3. **MBSE Bridge**: A trace chain (Requirement → Control → Test → Evidence → Decision) that makes requirements executable and decisions auditable

## Key Framework Components

### PROACTIVE Mnemonic (9 Principles)

| Letter | Principle | Enforcement |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **P** | Privacy-First | Collect minimum data; default local-only |
| **R** | Reality-Bound | Distinguish facts/inference/speculation |
| **O** | Observability | Emit structured logs; forensics-ready |
| **A** | Accessibility | Minimize cognitive load; support stepwise |
| **C** | Constitutional Constraints | Enforce rules as gates; never bypass |
| **T** | Truth or Bounded Unknown | Never misrepresent capability; mark uncertainty |
| **I** | Intent Integrity | Preserve user intent; refuse ambiguous execution |
| **V** | Verification Before Action | Perform checks before claiming success |
| **E** | Error Ownership | Own and repair mistakes instead of hiding |

### Six Invariants (I1-I6)

| Invariant | Name | Rule |
|-----------|------|------|
| **I1** | Evidence-First | Every claim must carry epistemic tag + evidence |
| **I2** | No Phantom Work | Cannot claim work unless artifact exists |
| **I3** | Confidence-Verification | High confidence only with verification artifacts |
| **I4** | Traceability Mandatory | REQ→CTRL→TEST→EVID→DECISION linked |
| **I5** | Safety Over Fluency | Bounded statements over fluent narrative |
| **I6** | Fail Closed | Stop and surface failure; do not work around |

### F1-F5 Failure Taxonomy

| Class | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **F1** | Confident False Claims | High confidence on objectively false statements |
| **F2** | Phantom Completion | Claiming work done when no artifact exists |
| **F3** | Persistence Under Correction | Maintaining false claims after correction |
| **F4** | Harm-Risk Coupling | False claims in high-consequence domains |
| **F5** | Cross-Episode Recurrence | Same failure patterns across sessions |

## Key Research Questions

1. **Effectiveness**: Does the framework reduce F1-F5 failure rates compared to baselines?
2. **Mechanism Attribution**: Which components (COL, IT-Loop, Validator, Trace) contribute most?
3. **Robustness**: Do invariants hold under adversarial pressure and distribution shift?
4. **Human Factors**: Can users understand intent receipts and detect errors?
5. **Scalability**: Does trace fidelity degrade at scale?
6. **Generalization**: Does the framework transfer across domains and architectures?

## Adapter Modules

The PROACTIVE framework includes adapter modules that integrate with external tools to validate specific principles and invariants.

| Adapter | Purpose | Validates | Status |
|---------|---------|-----------|--------|

| [02_CI_SAFETY_GATE](ADAPTER_MODULES/02_CI_SAFETY_GATE/) | GitHub Actions workflow for Constitutional Validator | Principle V (Verification) + I1-I6 (All Invariants) | ✅ Pilot Complete |

| 04_SAFETY_CASE_GENERATOR | Generate GSN safety cases from evidence | End-to-End Integration | 🔲 Not Started |

### Adapter 01: W&B Trace Adapter (Pilot Complete)

**Evidence Summary**: In a pilot study with 9 synthetic test cases covering F1 (overconfidence), F2 (phantom work), and F4 (incomplete trace) failure modes:

- **52% reduction** in root cause attribution time vs. standard W&B tables
- **100% accuracy** vs. 89% baseline accuracy
- **Statistical significance**: p < 0.0001, Cohen's d = 3.31 (large effect)

See [USE_CASE_EVIDENCE.md](ADAPTER_MODULES/01_WANDB_TRACE_ADAPTER/USE_CASE_EVIDENCE.md) for full validation report.

### Adapter 02: CI Safety Gate (Pilot Complete)

**Evidence Summary**: In a pilot study with 8 seeded test cases covering all 6 constitutional invariants (I1-I6):

- **100% detection rate** on seeded violations (8/8 expected violations detected)
- **0% false positive rate** on clean control case
- **19 total violations** detected across 7 test files
- All invariants validated: I1 (Evidence-First), I2 (No Phantom Work), I3 (Confidence-Verification), I4 (Traceability), I5 (Safety Over Fluency), I6 (Fail Closed)
